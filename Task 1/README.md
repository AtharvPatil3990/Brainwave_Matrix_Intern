# ATM Interface in Java

## Overview
This project is a **console-based ATM Interface** developed in Java, designed to simulate basic banking operations. The interface allows users to securely manage their bank accounts through various functionalities like balance inquiry, withdrawals, deposits, and PIN management.

This project is part of the tasks assigned during my internship at **[Company Name]** and focuses on implementing core Java concepts and object-oriented programming principles.
